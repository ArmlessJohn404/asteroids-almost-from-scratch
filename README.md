# ASTEROIDS ALMOST FROM SCRATCH
This is an attempt of reproducing the game [asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asteroids!) using modern programming languages. The idea is to track the progress and time each stage of development in this document. If possible, I want to finish this project in under 24h.

#### Check it out [here](https://armlessjohn404.github.io/asteroids-almost-from-scratch/)

The game is based in `html5 canvas`, `CSS` and `ES6 javascript`. No extra libraries or engines will be used.

Since I've already worked on a project to reproduce [spacewar-almost-from-scratch](https://armlessjohn404.github.io/spacewar-almost-from-scratch/), I'll be using much of it in here.

## GOALS
* Add `LICENSE.md` and `README.md
* Copy the `spacewar` files
* Host somewhere
* Modify `start screen`
* Modify `credits screen`
* Modify `game over screen`
* Make screens square
* Remove gravity and `blackhole`
* Modify `Ship` class
* Create `Asteroid` class
* Draw asteroids
* Create `Saucer` class
* Draw saucers
* Create `Score` class
* Modify collision mechanics
* Create life mechanics
* Create High scores screen
* Find someplace to host High scores
* Modify sounds
* Get play testers feedback
* List requests/bugs
* Fix requests/bugs
* Finished!

## Progress Reports
00:00 - Start! This project started October 23rd, 2016 at 17:30 (BRT). I'll be timing each step and will be placing the time it took from the beginning along with the achieved goal.

## 00:10 - LICENSE and README
This project is under a [GNU GPL3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) license. Have fun! :wink:

## 00:15 - Host somewhere
For now, I'll be hosting it in [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) since it's easy deploy. Check it out [here](https://armlessjohn404.github.io/asteroids-almost-from-scratch/)
